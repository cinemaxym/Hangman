## The Hangman Game 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Game Rules 

1. The game is played by guessing a secret word generated by the computer. The word is represented by a series of underscores, with each underscore representing a letter of the word.

2. The player starts guessing letters one at a time. If the guessed letter is in the secret word, all occurrences of that letter are revealed in the word. If the guessed letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman's body is drawn on the screen.

3. The game continues until either the player successfully guesses the entire word or the hangman is completely drawn.

4. The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends in failure. In traditional hangman, the player is allowed 11 incorrect guesses before the game ends.

5. The player is not allowed to guess the same letter twice.

6. The player can choose to give up at any time, forfeiting the game.

7. The game can be played alone or with multiple players taking turns guessing the secret word.

## Installation

1. Open the Terminal  
2. Navigate to the folder where is the `package.json` file located
3. Type `npm install`
4. Wait for the node_modules to be downloaded 
5. Type `npm start` to start the application on your local machine   

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
